additional.cohorts.results folder: this folder contains the results folders for more.cohorts8 and jd.cohorts15

tabs.from.parsing.results folder: this folder contains all 18 tables for the genetic architectures inferred for each simple architecture combination for each of the 6 possible combining functions when both simple architectures are known. 

tabs.from.parsingMargTab.results folder: this folder contains 5 tables for the genetic architectures inferred when one simple architectures is known for each of the 6 possible combining functions. 

fail.matrix.csv: this file is a table displaying the "failure rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures.

part.matrix.csv: this file is a table displaying the "partial success rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures.

res_betas.csv: this file is a table that takes the original sim.results and adds in the calculated beta coefficients for each defining function. Beta coefficients not calculated for division compound traits

sim.results.csv: this file is a table displaying the genetic architectures and corresponding beta coefficients that were inferred for each combination of simple architectures through 6 different combining functions.

sim.results-simplified-archs.csv: this file is a modified version of sim.results that simplifies the names of the genetic architectures by removing all capital "A" (ex. Aa --> a)

succ.matrix.csv: this file is a table displaying the "success rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures.

mult_comprange.csv: this file holds all of the differences in range between the high and low phenotype for each multiplicative compound trait; stored from the sim (5-cohort) 

res_a_percerr.csv: percent error calculated for compound traits where both elemental traits are additive
