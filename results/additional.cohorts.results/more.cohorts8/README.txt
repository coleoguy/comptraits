tabs.from.parsing.results folder: this folder contains all 18 tables for the genetic architectures inferred for each simple architecture combination for each of the 6 possible combining functions when both simple architectures are known. 

more.fail.matrix.csv: this file is a table displaying the "failure rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures.

more.part.matrix.csv: this file is a table displaying the "partial success rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures.

more.sim.results.csv: this file is a table displaying the genetic architectures and corresponding beta coefficients that were inferred for each combination of simple architectures through 6 different combining functions.

more.sim.results-simplified-archs.csv: this file is a modified version of more.cohort.sim.results that simplifies the names of the genetic architectures by removing all capital "A" (ex. Aa --> a)

more.succ.matrix.csv: this file is a table displaying the "success rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures.
