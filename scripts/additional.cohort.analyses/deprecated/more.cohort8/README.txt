more.cohort.failureMatrix.R: this script creates a matrix of the "failure rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures in data with 8 cohorts.

more.cohort.parsing.results.R: this script takes the results from more.cohort.simcoding.R and parses those results into tables showing the results of each elemental trait combination.

more.cohort.partialMatrix.R: this script creates a matrix of the "partial success rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures in data with 8 cohorts.

more.cohort.simcoding.R: this script pulls data from an empirical study of traits to inform the generation of simulated data and runs LCA on the simulated data using 8 cohorts and looking at additive, dominance, and epistatic genetic architectures. it writes a results file containing the genetic architectures inferred for the data.  

more.cohort.successMatrix.R: this script creates a matrix of the "success rate" for inferring the correct architectures under the six possible combining functions of all simple architectures in data with 8 cohorts.
